    During my degree at WCE,Sangli I learnt lots of key skills such as appttiude, logical thinking, team work and project management. I 
    graduated as Electronics Engineer which is quite opposite to what I am pursuing today. Still I believe that in a way it helped me 
    realised my potential and interest. 

    While at college I spent my free time with the Rotaract Club. In my final year I was President of the club.
