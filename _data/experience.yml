    While working at Nudge I was able to work on a large number of projects ranging from small Drupal sites to large
    enterprise level applications. I enjoy being able to work with clients to understand and surpass their expectations.
    At Nudge I was also given the oppertunity to work with all of my core skills and to gain new skills in things
    such as <mark>Symfony</mark>, <mark>Angular</mark> and <mark>Gulp</mark>. I also worked on a number of <mark>iOS</mark> and
    <mark>Android</mark> applications.

    During my time at Nudge I was able to help the lead developer with the writing of Technical Specifications and
    also Project Requirements. I feel this is a useful skill to have as it helps me to become an even more well-rounded
    developer.

    During the summer I had the opportunity to head to Accra, Ghana and work with the team out there. This was a
    great opportunity to learn more about the industry in another country but also to allow me to lead their
    team for a few weeks and gain lots of experience of remote teams.
