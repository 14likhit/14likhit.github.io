                <p>Hi, my name is James Grant. I am full stack web and mobile app developer with 3 years experience based in the west country. I am currently working for Nudge Digital where I have been building a variety of different things from <kbd>Drupal</kbd> sites to <kbd>Android</kbd> and <kbd>iOS</kbd> apps while also working with MVC frameworks such as <kbd>Codeignighter</kbd> and <kbd>Symfony</kbd>.</p>

                <p>I like making nice simple UI thats quick and easy to use giving users a good experience. I can work with all sorts of different languages and frameworks but the things that I have the most experience working with are:</p>
                <p><kbd>Drupal</kbd>, <kbd>Symfony</kbd>, <kbd>Android</kbd>, <kbd>iOS</kbd>, <kbd>CodeIgniter</kbd>, <kbd>SASS</kbd>, <kbd>JS</kbd>, <kbd>JQuery</kbd>, <kbd>Angular</kbd>, <kbd>git</kbd>, <kbd>Gulp</kbd> and <kbd>Heroku</kbd>.</p>

                <p class="quote">Forecastr is an android app designed to make it easy to view your favourite spots. Targeted at sports where the weather is key to a good session forecastr makes it quick to see which spot is best all on one screen. Forecastr includes wind, weather, swell and tide times all in one place.</p>
                <p>Forecastr is an app I have been building as I have a keen interest in <kbd>android</kbd> development and wanted a personal project I could use to build my skills. I choose to build this app as I felt like its something I would use myself and also something that would set some good chalenges in lots of different areas of the build.</p>
                <p>During the build I have utilised a number of different android libraries such as ActionBarSherlock, Dagger and Otto. As well as these the app also talks to a backend API and uses a SQLite DB.</p>

                <p>The backend for this site has been build using <kbd>Symfony</kbd> while on the front end I have used <kbd>SASS</kbd>, Bourbon.io, Neat and <kbd>Jquery</kbd>. The front-end assets are being compiled and minified using <kbd>Gulp</kbd> so this can be easily auto-deployed using <kbd>Heroku</kbd></p>
                <p>I have really enjoyed working with the codebase I have created on this project as it has allowed me to build on my exisiting skills while play around and learn some new useful skills.</p>

                <p>Over the past year with nudge I have been able to work on a large number of projects ranging from small Drupal sites to large enterprise level applications. I enjoy being able to work with clients to understand and surpass their expectations. At Nudge I have also been given to oppertunity to work with all of my core skills and also to gain new skills in things such as <kbd>Symfony</kbd>, <kbd>Angular</kbd> and <kbd>Gulp</kbd>.</p>
                <p>During my time at nudge I have also been able to help the lead developer with the writing of Technical Specifications and also Project Requirements. I feel this is a usefull skill to have as it helps me to become and even more well-rounded developer.</p>
                <p>During the summer I had the opertunity to head to Accra, Ghana and work with the team out there. This was a great opertunity to learn more about the industry in another country but also to allow me to lead their team for a few weeks and gain lots of experince of remote teams.</p>

                <p>I started working for GWS Media part time during my third year at University and continued full time once I had graduated. It was during this role that I learnt many of the fundamentals that I have been building on over the past 3 years. Whilst at GWS I had the oppertunity to work with: <kbd>Drupal</kbd>, <kbd>Magento</kbd>, <kbd>Bootstrap</kbd>, <kbd>Codeigniter</kbd>, <kbd>Android</kbd> and <kbd>iOS</kbd>.</p>
                <p>I feel like having the oppertunity to use to many different tools early on in my career had given me the drive to always want to try new tools and frameworks.</p>
