            <p>Hi, my name is James Grant, I'm a full stack web and mobile app developer with 5+ years experience based in the South West.
                I am currently working for the Royal Bank of Scotland as a frontend software engineer on a comercial banking platform.

            <p>I enjoy making clean and interactive UI that is quick and easy to use whilst also giving users an enjoyable experience.
                I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities
                to work with something new. The things that I currently have the most experience working with are:</p>
            <p>
                <kbd>PHP</kbd>,
                <kbd>ES6 Javascript</kbd>,

            <p>The API for this site has been build using <kbd>Symfony</kbd> while the front end is a <kbd>React</kbd>/<kbd>Redux</kbd> app.
                I have used <kbd>Docker</kbd> to set up a development environment and <kbd>Heroku</kbd> to deploy and host the site. I have
                a suite of unit and API tests for the backend and unit tests for the fronted.
            </p>
            <p>I have been using this project as a way to increase many of my skills and also learn new things. I have particually

                sports where the weather is key to a good session forecastr makes it quick to see which spot is best all
                on one screen. Forecastr includes wind, weather, swell and tide times.</p>

            <p>Forecastr is an app I have been building as I have a keen interest in
                <kbd>Android</kbd> development and wanted a personal project I could use to help build my skills. I chose to build
                this app as I felt like it's something I would use myself and also something that would set some good challenges
                across lots of different areas of the build.</p>

            <p>During the build I have utilised a number of different android libraries such as ActionBarSherlock, Dagger and
                Otto. As well as these the app also talks to a backend API and uses a SQLite DB.</p>

            <p>During my time at Simitive I worked as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and
                also a large scale website for an international client. I gained experience working with a continuous integration
                workflow using tools such as <kbd>Jenkins</kbd> and working with Amazon Web Services for deployments. We built most
                of our software using <kbd>Symfony</kbd>, <kbd>Backbone</kbd>, <kbd>Marionette</kbd>, <kbd>Vue</kbd> and <kbd>Vuex</kbd>.</p>

            <p>For 6 months I was working on delivering a standalone web product for an international client that services over
                600,000 users. This has been built from the ground up using <kbd>Symfony</kbd> to provide a backend API and
                <kbd>Backbone</kbd> for the front end. I also gained a lot of experience with <kbd>Elasticsearch</kbd> to provide
                search functionality of millions of entities to the front end. During the project I spent time out of hours
                communicating with the client, performing deployments and providing support.</p>

            <p>Towards the end of my time at Simitive my role involved assisting with the company's devOps, this included managing
                our
                <kbd>AWS</kbd> infrastructure as well as deploying and migrating sites. I also spend time configuring and maintaining
                our clients SSO, this mostly involves configuring new clients who are using
                <kbd>AD FS</kbd>,
                <kbd>Shibboleth</kbd> and
                <kbd>CAS</kbd> but also maintaining our software's SSO functionality.</p>

            <p>While working at Nudge I was able to work on a large number of projects ranging from small Drupal sites to large
                enterprise level applications. I enjoy being able to work with clients to understand and surpass their expectations.
                At Nudge I was also given the oppertunity to work with all of my core skills and to gain new skills in things
                such as
                <kbd>Symfony</kbd>,
                <kbd>Angular</kbd> and
                <kbd>Gulp</kbd>. I also worked on a number of

                <kbd>Android</kbd> applications.</p>
            <p>During my time at Nudge I was able to help the lead developer with the writing of Technical Specifications and
                also Project Requirements. I feel this is a useful skill to have as it helps me to become an even more well-rounded
                developer.

            <p>During the summer I had the opportunity to head to Accra, Ghana and work with the team out there. This was a
                great opportunity to learn more about the industry in another country but also to allow me to lead their
                team for a few weeks and gain lots of experience of remote teams.</p>

                mountain biking, road cycling, kitesuring and landboarding as well as trying to make time for things like
                rock climbing and playing some rugby. Since my time at Uni I have become a very keen Kitesurfer and freestyle
                Landboarder. In 2014 I competed and won the amateur landboard British powerkite tour.</p>
            <p>I am very interested in photography and videography as I like to be creative. This is mainly through sport but
                I enjoy landscape and abstract photography too. I like to showcase my work on my website and instagram if
