                <p>Hi, my name is James Grant. I'm a full stack web and mobile app developer with 3 years experience based in the west country. I am currently working for Nudge Digital where I have been building a variety of different products from <kbd>Drupal</kbd> sites to <kbd>Android</kbd> and <kbd>iOS</kbd> apps while also working with MVC frameworks such as <kbd>CodeIgniter</kbd> and <kbd>Symfony</kbd>.</p>

                <p>I like making clean and interactive UI that is quick and easy to use whilst also giving users an enjoyable experience. I have worked with a range of different languages and frameworks and I am always looking for opportunities to work with something new. The things that I have the most experience working with are:</p>
                <p><kbd>PHP</kbd>, <kbd>MySQL</kbd>, <kbd>Drupal</kbd>, <kbd>Symfony</kbd>, <kbd>Android</kbd>, <kbd>iOS</kbd>, <kbd>CodeIgniter</kbd>, <kbd>SASS</kbd>, <kbd>JS</kbd>, <kbd>JQuery</kbd>, <kbd>Angular</kbd>, <kbd>git</kbd> and <kbd>Gulp</kbd>.</p>

Targeted at sports where the weather is key to a good session forecastr makes it quick to see which spot is best all on one screen. Forecastr includes wind, weather, swell and tide times.</p>
                <p>Forecastr is an app I have been building as I have a keen interest in <kbd>Android</kbd> development and wanted a personal project I could use to help build my skills. I chose to build this app as I felt like it's something I would use myself and also something that would set some good challenges across lots of different areas of the build.</p>
                <p>During the build I have utilised a number of different android libraries such as ActionBarSherlock, Dagger and Otto. As well as these the app also talks to a backend API and uses a SQLite DB.</p>

                <p>The backend for this site has been build using <kbd>Symfony</kbd> while on the front-end I have used <kbd>SASS</kbd>, Bourbon.io, Neat and <kbd>JQuery</kbd>. The front-end assets are being compiled and minified using <kbd>Gulp</kbd> so this can be easily auto-deployed on <kbd>Heroku</kbd></p>
                <p>I have really enjoyed working on this project as I have been able to create a really nice codebase that is fun to work with, and also play with some new components that I wouldn't usually have the time to work with.</p>

                <p>I have been working as part of an agile team building our own in house web based software and also a large scale website for an international client. I have been gaining experience working with continuous integration workflow using tools such as <kbd>Jenkins</kbd>, working with Amazon Web Services and building software using <kbd>Symfony</kbd>, <kbd>Backbone</kbd>, <kbd>Marionette</kbd>, <kbd>Vue</kbd> and <kbd>Vuex</kbd>.</p>
                <p>For most of my time I have been working on delivering one web product for a international client that services over 600,000 users. This has been built from the ground up using <kbd>Symfony</kbd> to provide a backend API and Backbone for the front end. I also gained a lot of experience with <kbd>Elasticsearch</kbd> to provide search functionality of millions of entities to the front end. During the project I spent time out of hours communicating with the client and performing support.</p>
                <p>I am currently working in a team of 4 working on building internal web software this time using <kbd>Vue</kbd> and <kbd>Vuex</kbd> for the front end application. I am constantly providing input into the projects from a functionality and technical side which I feel makes me a very valuable asset to the team.</p>

                <p>Over the past year with nudge I have been able to work on a large number of projects ranging from small Drupal sites to large enterprise level applications. I enjoy being able to work with clients to understand and surpass their expectations. At Nudge I have also been given the oppertunity to work with all of my core skills and also to gain new skills in things such as <kbd>Symfony</kbd>, <kbd>Angular</kbd> and <kbd>Gulp</kbd>.</p>
                <p>During my time at Nudge I have also been able to help the lead developer with the writing of Technical Specifications and also Project Requirements. I feel this is a useful skill to have as it helps me to become an even more well-rounded developer.</p>
                <p>During the summer I had the opportunity to head to Accra, Ghana and work with the team out there. This was a great opportunity to learn more about the industry in another country but also to allow me to lead their team for a few weeks and gain lots of experience of remote teams.</p>

                <p>I feel like having the opportunity to use a large range of different things early on in my career has given me the drive to always want to try new tools and frameworks.</p>
