  When I'm not at my desk I am very active traveller and spend most of my time outdoors. I love running and cycling. Just fininshed one half-marathon.
  Also I like cooking, writing poem and reading. Since my time in Engineering I have become a very keen cook and believe
  cooking helps me learn experimentation. In 2019 I competed Jagriti Yatra, a unique 15 day train journey which covers 
  almost 8000km across India.

  Writing poems have help me expand my creativity. I like to write poems in Hindi. 
  I like to showcase my work on my instagram, if you would like to take a look -

  Finally during the rest of my free time you will either find me reading books or watching documentaries.
